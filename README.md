# cs123b-final-proj
A pair of Google Colab Notebooks that use binary classification models to predict cancer patient outcomes using a dataset from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons database (https://gdc.cancer.gov/content/next-generation-cancer-knowledge-base).
- Data_Processing.ipynb does data preprocessing
- Models.ipynb trains and runs the machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Linear Regression, MLP, SLP)
- clinical.json is the dataset of 279 cancer patient cases

# How to run the code
1. Download the clinical.json dataset.
2. In your Shared Google Drives, create a folder called "123B Project". Create an additional subfolder inside that called "279_cases". Create an additional subfolder inside that called "csv".
3. Upload clinical.json inside the 279_cases folder.
4. Open Data_Processing.ipynb in Google Colab and run it.
5. After that is finished, open Models.ipynb in Google Colab and run it.
6. Done!
